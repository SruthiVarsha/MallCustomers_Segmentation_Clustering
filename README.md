# Mall Customers Segmentation
Customers who come for shopping in a mall can be grouped in a number of ways. Shopping pattern, spending pattern, shopping score, salary etc are some of the factors that can be used to divide the customers into different categories.

The reason for these clusters is to help identify those customers who would be interested in certain products, offers and services. The store may strategize its offerings in such a way that it targets only right customers for specific products. This helps in creating a win-win situation for both the store (in terms of revenue and more customers through customer recommendation) and the customer (discounts, offers, reward points, gifts, etc)

# Business Objective:
To create Customer cluster to identify the different types of customers
